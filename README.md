# My Programming Languages Learning Journey

This repository contains my practice projects and exercises in different programming languages Iâ€™ve explored over time.  
Itâ€™s a record of my growth and experiments as I learn new tools and approaches in programming.

## ðŸ“‚ Languages & Topics Covered
- **MySQL** â€” database creation, queries, data manipulation, and simple relational designs.
- **MATLAB** â€” numerical computations, plotting graphs, and solving mathematical problems.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** â€” classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism (in various languages).
- **Visual Basic (VB)** â€” simple desktop applications, forms, and event-driven programming.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository is a collection of my beginner-to-intermediate exercises in different programming languages, each helping me develop problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

## ðŸš€ How to Use / View
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to each language folder (e.g., `/mysql/`, `/matlab/`, `/oop/`, `/visual-basic/`).
3. Open the files in the appropriate software or editor:
   - MySQL: Use a MySQL server environment like XAMPP, WAMP, or MySQL Workbench.
   - MATLAB: Open `.m` files in MATLAB.
   - OOP: Open in the respective programming environment (Java, C++, etc.).
   - Visual Basic: Open `.vb` files in Visual Studio.

## ðŸ—’ Notes
- These are mostly learning exercises and small projects.
- Iâ€™ll continue to add new files as I learn more advanced concepts.
- Each folder may have its own README for detailed instructions.
